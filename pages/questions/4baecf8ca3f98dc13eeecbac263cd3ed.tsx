      <h1>QUESTION 4:</h1>

      <p>
        The war is nearly over. The allied forces are making their final push
        into the enemy&apos;s heartland. Their desperation has resulted in
        random rocket attacks against our troops. Luckily, the enemy&apos;s
        R&amp;D department has defected over to our side and there have been no
        further encoding machines produced. Therefore, the current MARK IV is
        still being used to direct the rocket attacks. Now, we need to decode
        the enemy messages so we can move our troops out of harms way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your mission is to write a decryption function into your virtual machine
        so we can intercept the encoded messages and decode them.
      </p>

      <p>
        JSON question... Given wheel positions of 7,2 and an encrypted message
        found in the JSON question, what is the resulting message?
