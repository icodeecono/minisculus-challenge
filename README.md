# Minisculus Challenge Server

The [Minisculus Challenge](http://minisculuschallenge.com/) launched
during the Software Crafstmanship 2010 conference at Blethcley Park.

The challenge required a simple JSON rest api and some accompanying web pages.

New version is a quick port into next.js to get off Heroku. Some fancy routing is done in the middleware.tsx file to match the original challenge routing.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
